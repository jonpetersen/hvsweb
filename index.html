              The Village Shop is nestled in the Surrey Hills, next to the
              Cricket Green in the beautiful village of Hambledon, Surrey. The
              Shop is owned and run by the community and in its small space
              provides a grocery shop, an off-license, a newsagent, a café, a
              delicatessen and a Post Office. Most important of all, it provides
              a communal hub where locals and visitors can meet and mingle, or
              just enjoy a quiet coffee in beautiful and peaceful surroundings.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Shop has a modern disabled accessible toilet and nappy
              changing facility, fast and free Wi-Fi (just ask for the password), a kids’ play area,
              complimentary dog biscuits and plenty of free on-street parking.
